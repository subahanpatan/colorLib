                <p>We value our customerâ€™s time and hence moved away from a single customer care number to a
                    comprehensive chat-based support system for quick and easy resolution. You no longer have
                    to go through the maze of an IVRS call support. Just search for your issue in the help 
                    section on this page and initiate a chat with us. A customer care executive will be 
                    assigned to you shortly. You can also email us your issue on colorLib.in@gmail.com

                    Note: We value your privacy and your information is safe with us. Please do not reveal 
                    any personal information, bank account number, OTP etc. to another person. A ColorLib 
                    representative will never ask you for these details. Please do not reveal these details 
                    to fraudsters and imposters claiming to be calling on our behalf. Be vigilant and do not 
                    entertain phishing calls or emails.</p>
